Today I added an interface to the **[freshwaterecology database](http://www.freshwaterecology.info)** to taxize.

Currently only the macro-invertebrate database is supported, but I'll work also on the other four databases.

The functions have the ```fresh``` prefix and to use them you need the development version from github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
require(devtools)
install_github("taxize_", "ropensci")
require(taxize)
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
require(taxize)
```

Example
-------------------------

Let's say we have a species list:
```{r}
spec <- c("Aeshna grandis",
"Baetis rodani",
"Anax imperator",
"Asellus aquaticus",
"Gammarus pulex")
```

We can check if our taxa are valid using the [Taxa Validation Tool (TVT)](http://www.freshwaterecology.info/TaxaDB_TVT.php). 

From within R we can use the new function ```fresh_validate```:
```{r cache=TRUE}
spec_val <- fresh_validate(spec)
spec_val
```

We see that all taxa except the second (obviously a typo) are valid. 

We can also query the AQEM, DV, TCM, Furse, Perla, Ecoprof-Codes for these species (using ```fresh_codes```) or query ecological parameters (using ```fresh_traits``).

Currently the freshwaterecology-database comprises 40 Traits with 224 Modalities. You can get an overview from the description-table ```fresh_desc``` which is part of the taxize package:

```{r}
tail(fresh_desc)
```

Getting the traits for our species is simple: We can use the object returned by ```fresh_validate``` (which contains a cookie) with ```fresh_traits```:

```{r eval=FALSE}
spec_traits <- fresh_traits(spec_val)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
spec_traits <- fresh_traits(fresh_validate(spec))
```



```fresh_traits``` queries always all available ecological parameters, which yields to a very wide data.frame:
```{r}
dim(spec_traits)
```

I we want to have only a subset of traits, we can use the above mentioned description table:

```{r}
take <- fresh_desc$Modality[fresh_desc$Trait %in% c('reproduction', 'respiration')]
spec_traits[ , c('x', take)]
```

Integrating the other four databases is on my ToDo-list.


The fresh_* functions are under development, so if you have suggestions or find bugs contact me:
either on [github](https://github.com/ropensci/taxize_/issues?state=open) or [on this site](http://edild.github.com/contact/).
