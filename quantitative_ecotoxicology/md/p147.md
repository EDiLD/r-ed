This is about example 4.3 on page 147 of [Quantitative Ecotoxicology](http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781439835647). This example is about Calculations of $LC_{50}$ values.
In this post I won't reproduce the SAS-Code since I do not have any experience with SAS PROC PROBIT and I do not fully understand whats happening there.

Instead I will fit Dose-Response-Models using the `drc`-package to this data.


Get the data from [here](https://raw.github.com/EDiLD/r-ed/master/quantitative_ecotoxicology/data/p147.csv) and read it into R:


```r
require(RCurl)
url <- getURL("https://raw.github.com/EDiLD/r-ed/master/quantitative_ecotoxicology/data/p147.csv")
salt <- read.table(text = url, header = TRUE, sep = ";")
```


```r
head(salt)
```

```
##   DEAD TOTAL CONC
## 1   16    76 10.3
## 2   22    79 10.8
## 3   40    77 11.6
## 4   69    76 13.2
## 5   78    78 15.8
## 6   77    77 20.1
```


So the data consists of number of dead animals (DEAD) from all animals (TOTAL) exposed to a concentration (CONC).
First we create a new column with the proportion of dead animals:


```r
salt$prop <- salt$DEAD/salt$TOTAL
```


Lets have a look at the raw data (note that I use a logarithmic scale for the x-axis):

```r
plot(salt$CONC, salt$prop, xlab = "Concentration", ylab = "Proportion dead", 
    log = "x")
```

I will use the drc-package of Christian Ritz and Jens Strebig to fit dose-response-curves to this data. The main function of this package is `drm`:


Here I fit a two-parameter log-logistic model to the data (see <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.7">Ritz (2010)</a> for a review of dose-response-models used in ecotoxicology):

```r
require(drc)
mod <- drm(prop ~ CONC, data = salt, fct = LL.2())
```


So the usage is similar to `lm()` or `nls()`, except the `fct` argument. This argument defines the model that is fitted to the data.

We can compare this model with other models using the AIC (the smaller the better). 

Here I compare the 2-parameter log-logistic model with a two-parameter Weibull and a 2-parameter Gompertz model. 

`drc` has for this purpose the `mselect()` function that shows some diagnostics for every model:

* likelihood (the higher the better; however use this only when your models are nested)
* AIC (the lower the better)
* residual variance (the lower the better)


```r
mselect(mod, fctList = list(W1.2(), G.2()))
```

```
##      logLik      IC Lack of fit    Res var
## LL.2 14.613 -23.226          NA 0.00067322
## G.2  11.903 -17.806          NA 0.00166155
## W1.2 10.718 -15.437          NA 0.00246584
```


The LL.2-model has the lowest AIC so I will keep this. 
Lets see how the model looks like:

```r
# raw data
plot(prop ~ CONC, data = salt, xlim = c(9, 21), ylim = c(0, 1), ylab = "Proportion dead", 
    xlab = "Concentration")

conc_pred <- seq(9, 21, 0.1)
lines(conc_pred, predict(mod, newdata = data.frame(CONC = conc_pred)))
```

We can get the $LC_{50}$ with confidence interval from the model using the `ED()` function:

```r
ED(mod, 50, interval = "delta")
```

```
## 
## Estimated effective doses
## (Delta method-based confidence interval(s))
## 
##      Estimate Std. Error   Lower Upper
## 1:50  11.4768     0.0575 11.3171  11.6
```
