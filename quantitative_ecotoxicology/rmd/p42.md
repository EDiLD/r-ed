### Quantitative Ecotoxicology, page 42, example 2.4, Wilcoxon rank sum test

Get the data from [here](https://raw.github.com/EDiLD/r-ed/master/quantitative_ecotoxicology/data/p42.csv) and read it into R:




```r
SULFATE <- read.table("p42.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ";")
```



It is quite easy to perform a wilcoxon-test with the function wilcox.test:

```r
wilcox.test(SO4 ~ SITE, SULFATE, correct = TRUE)
```

```
## Warning: cannot compute exact p-value with ties
```

```
## 
## 	Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction
## 
## data:  SO4 by SITE 
## W = 330.5, p-value = 0.00563
## alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0
```



```r
wilcox.test(SO4 ~ SITE, SULFATE, correct = TRUE, alternative = "greater")
```

```
## Warning: cannot compute exact p-value with ties
```

```
## 
## 	Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction
## 
## data:  SO4 by SITE 
## W = 330.5, p-value = 0.002815
## alternative hypothesis: true location shift is greater than 0
```
