```{r setup, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE, message=FALSE}
options(scipen = 1, digits = 5)
require(knitcitations)

```

This is example 5.1 on page 223 of [Quantitative Ecotoxicology](http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781439835647) - reproduced with R. 


#### Load and clean the data
Read the data into R:
```{r}
df <- read.table(header = TRUE, text = 'conc A B C D
0 1 1 0.9 0.9
32 0.8 0.8 1 0.8
64 0.9 1 1 1 
128 0.9 0.9 0.8 1
256 0.7 0.9 1 0.5
512 0.4 0.3 0.4 0.2')
df
```

Next we do some house-keeping: convert the data to long format and the concentration to factor.
```{r, message=FALSE}
require(reshape2)
# to long
dfm <- melt(df, id.vars = 'conc', value.name = 'y', variable.name = 'tank')
# conc as factor
dfm$conc <- factor(dfm$conc)
head(dfm)
```

Let's have first look at the data:
```{r}
boxplot(y ~ conc, data = dfm, 
        xlab = 'conc', ylab = 'Proportion surv.')
```

#### Transform response
Next we apply the arcsine transformation:
```{r}
dfm$y_asin <- ifelse(dfm$y == 1, 
                     asin(sqrt(dfm$y)) - asin(sqrt(1/40)), 
                     asin(sqrt(dfm$y)) 
                     )
```
This adds the transformed values as column `y_asin` to our data.frame. 
Survivals of 1 (100%) are transformed 

$$arcsin(sqrt(y)) - arcsin(sqrt(1/(4n))) =$$ 

$$arcsin(1) - arcsin(sqrt(1/(4*10))) = $$

$$1.5708 - 0.1588 = $$

$$ 1.412$$

all other values are transformed using
$$arcsin(sqrt(y))$$.

Let's look at the transformed values:
```{r}
head(dfm)
boxplot(y_asin ~ conc, data = dfm, 
        xlab = 'conc', ylab = 'Transformed prop. surv.')
```

Doesn't look that different...

#### ANOVA
To fit a ANOVA to his data we use the `aov()` function:
```{r}
mod <- aov(y_asin ~ conc, data = dfm)
```

And `summary()` gives the anova table:
```{r}
summary(mod)
```
The within-treatment variance is termed *Residuals* and the between-treatment variance is named according to the predictor *conc*. The total variance is simply the sum of those and not displayed.

R already performed an F-test for us, indicated by the *F value* and *Pr (>F)* columns. 


#### Multiple Comparisons
Now we know that there is a statistically significant treatment effect, we might be interested which treatments differ from the control group. 

The in the book mentioned Tukey contrasts (comparing each level with each other) can be easily done with the `multcomp` package:

```{r, message=FALSE}
require(multcomp)
summary(glht(mod, linfct = mcp(conc = 'Tukey')))
```

However, this leads to 15 comparisons (and tests) and we may not be interested in all. Note that we are wrong in 1 out of 20 tests ($\alpha = 0.05$) (if we do not apply correction for multiple testing). 

An alternative would be just to compare the control group to the treatments. This is called *Dunnett contrasts* and lead to only 5 comparison.

The syntax is the same, just change Tukey to Dunnett:
```{r, message=FALSE}
summary(glht(mod, linfct = mcp(conc = 'Dunnett')))
```

Note, that the p-values are already corrected for multiple testing. If you want to change the correction method you can use:
```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
summary(glht(mod, linfct = mcp(conc = 'Dunnett')), test = adjusted('bonferroni'))
```

This applies Bonferroni-correction, see `?p.adjust` and `?adjusted` for other methods.

#### Outlook
Warton & Hui (2011) demonstrated that *that the arcsine transform should not be used in either circumstance*. Similarly as O’Hara & Kotze (2010) showed that count data should not be log-transformed. 

I a future post I will show how to analyse this data without transformation using GLM and some simulations showing that using GLM can lead to an increased statistical power for ecotoxicological data sets.
