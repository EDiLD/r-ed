This is example 4.9 on page 178 of [Quantitative Ecotoxicology](http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781439835647) - time-to-death data.

Thankfully, Prof. Newman provided me the data for this example. You can get it from the github-repo ([TOXICTY.csv](https://raw.github.com/EDiLD/r-ed/master/quantitative_ecotoxicology/data/TOXICITY.csv)).

```{r message=FALSE}
require(RCurl)
url <- getURL("https://raw.github.com/EDiLD/r-ed/master/quantitative_ecotoxicology/data/TOXICITY.csv",
ssl.verifypeer = FALSE)
TOXICITY <- read.table(text = url, header = TRUE)
head(TOXICITY)
summary(TOXICITY)
```

The data consists of 5 columns:

* TTD   :     Time to death
* TANK  :     Tank
* PPT   :     NaCl Concentration
* WETWT :     wet weight
* STDLGTH :   Standard length

Columns 4 and 5 have 70 NA's (no data available due to measurement error), but we won't use these in this example. The observations with TTD = 97 are 'survivors', since the experiment run only 96 hours.


First we need to create a column `FLAG` for the status of the animal (dead/alive):
```{r}
TOXICITY$FLAG <- ifelse(TOXICITY$TTD > 96, 1, 2)
```
So 1 denotes alive and 2 dead.

Then we can plot the data. Each line is a tank and colors denote the NaCl concentrations.
```{r message=FALSE}
require(survival)
mod <- survfit(Surv(TTD, FLAG) ~ PPT + strata(TANK), data = TOXICITY)
plot(mod, col = rep(1:7, each=2), mark.time=FALSE)
legend('bottomleft', legend = sort(unique(TOXICITY$PPT)), col=1:7, lty = 1)
```

We see a clear relationship between concentration and the survival curves. In  this example we are interested in differences between the duplicates. We see that the two curves for the 11.6 g/L concentration are quite similar, while there is more divergence between tanks in the 13.2 g/L treatment.

We can test for differences using the `survdiff` function. With the `rho` argument we can specify the type of test: `rho = 0` is a log-rank test and `rho = 1` is equivalent to the Peto & Peto modification of the Gehan-Wilcoxon test.


First the log-rank test for each concentration:
```{r}
survdiff(Surv(TTD, FLAG) ~ TANK, data = TOXICITY[TOXICITY$PPT==10.3, ], rho = 0)
survdiff(Surv(TTD, FLAG) ~ TANK, data = TOXICITY[TOXICITY$PPT==10.8, ], rho = 0)
survdiff(Surv(TTD, FLAG) ~ TANK, data = TOXICITY[TOXICITY$PPT==11.6, ], rho = 0)
survdiff(Surv(TTD, FLAG) ~ TANK, data = TOXICITY[TOXICITY$PPT==13.2, ], rho = 0)
survdiff(Surv(TTD, FLAG) ~ TANK, data = TOXICITY[TOXICITY$PPT==15.8, ], rho = 0)
```

Like in the book none of the tests shows a p < 0.05.

We could also run this in a `for` loop (here the Wilcoxon test):
```{r}
for(i in sort(unique(TOXICITY$PPT)[-c(2,7)])) {
  cat('\n', i, '\n')
  print(survdiff(Surv(TTD, FLAG) ~ TANK, data = TOXICITY[TOXICITY$PPT==i, ], rho = 1))
}
```

Basically we get the same results as in the book: 

The wilcoxon test for the 13.2 g/L treatment shows a p < 0.05. 

The $\chi^2$ values differ slightly but share the same trend - I suspect this is due to different data used.

With this dataset we can do much more. We already saw that there might be a relationship between survival time and concentration, but more on this later (example 4.10).

Code and data are available on my [github-repo](https://github.com/EDiLD/r-ed/tree/master/quantitative_ecotoxicology) under file name 'p176'.
