This is about example 4.3 on page 147 of [Quantitative Ecotoxicology](http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781439835647). This example is about Calculations of $LC_{50}$ values.
In this post I won't reproduce the SAS-Code since I do not have any experience with SAS PROC PROBIT and I do not fully understand whats happening there.

Instead I will fit Dose-Response-Models using the `drc`-package to this data.


Get the data from [here](https://raw.github.com/EDiLD/r-ed/master/quantitative_ecotoxicology/data/p147.csv) and read it into R:

```{r message=FALSE}
require(RCurl)
url <- getURL("https://raw.github.com/EDiLD/r-ed/master/quantitative_ecotoxicology/data/p147.csv")
salt <- read.table(text = url, header = TRUE, sep = ";")
```
```{r}
head(salt)
```

So the data consists of number of dead animals (DEAD) from all animals (TOTAL) exposed to a concentration (CONC).
First we create a new column with the proportion of dead animals:

```{r}
salt$prop <- salt$DEAD / salt$TOTAL
```

Lets have a look at the raw data (note that I use a logarithmic scale for the x-axis):
```{r p147_plot_raw}
plot(salt$CONC, salt$prop, xlab = 'Concentration', ylab = 'Proportion dead', log='x')
```


I will use the drc-package of Christian Ritz and Jens Strebig to fit dose-response-curves to this data. The main function of this package is `drm`:


Here I fit a two-parameter log-logistic model to the data (see `r citet('10.1002/etc.7')` for a review of dose-response-models used in ecotoxicology):
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
require(drc)
mod <- drm(prop ~ CONC, data = salt, fct =  LL.2())
```

So the usage is similar to `lm()` or `nls()`, except the `fct` argument. This argument defines the model that is fitted to the data.

We can compare this model with other models using the AIC (the smaller the better). 

Here I compare the 2-parameter log-logistic model with a two-parameter Weibull and a 2-parameter Gompertz model. 

`drc` has for this purpose the `mselect()` function that shows some diagnostics for every model:

* likelihood (the higher the better; however use this only when your models are nested)
* AIC (the lower the better)
* residual variance (the lower the better)

```{r, warning=FALSE}
mselect(mod, fctList=list(W1.2(),G.2()))
```

The LL.2-model has the lowest AIC so I will keep this. 
Lets see how the model looks like:
```{r p147_plot_mod}
# raw data
plot(prop ~ CONC, data = salt, xlim = c(9,21), ylim = c(0,1), ylab = 'Proportion dead', xlab = 'Concentration')

conc_pred <- seq(9, 21, 0.1)
lines(conc_pred, predict(mod, newdata = data.frame(CONC = conc_pred)))
```

We can get the $LC_{50}$ with confidence interval from the model using the `ED()` function:
```{r}
ED(mod, 50, interval='delta')
```
